# NieRThemes
This mod allows you to play music from all 3 major additions of the NieR series (NieR: Replicant (Gestalt and v1.22), NieR: Automata, and NieR: Re[in]carnation) in place of Risk of Rain 2's original music. Each track is looped (nearly seamlessly) to 15-30 minutes long, to optimize immersion.

This "mod" is built on kylepaulsen's OriginalSoundTrack mod (credits to them).

This mod is not related to diggy's NierSoundtrack mod.
